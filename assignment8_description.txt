Jiajun did part2, Hex did part3 and Laural did part1 and helped part3.
For part1, the hardest part is to use the imported library to draw bargraph.
For part2, I had troubles to select the datas that I wanted. It also took some time to build those buttons.
For part3, different pages caused some problem, and many buttons were used.
